## Task Description

Create an API for an Inventory Management System.
While the number and endpoints specifics are left to your imagination, the API should handle:

    * Product creation, deletion, update and retrieval.
    * Adding product to cart and purchasing product
    * Keeping track of product quantity in regards to purchase or add to cart functions, i.e the product quantity should reduce when a purchase is made, or when it is added to the "user's" cart; users should be informed when a product is "out of stock"
    * Products should have (name, category, labels(e.g size, colour etc), quantity, price) A product can have one or more labels.

Important Notes:

*The User APIs can be ignored, it is assumed that there are users already registered who can purchase or add to cart (this section may be hardcoded or discarded)
* There is no need to integrate an actual payment API and extra marks won't be given for it. You can assume that your payment endpoint will debit the user and perform a payment provider shenanigans.
Tech stack:

Project should be handled written in Flask/Django
Use a database of your choice
